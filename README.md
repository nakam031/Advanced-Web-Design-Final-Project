# Advanced Web Design Final Project (Re-designing Existing Website)
In the Advanced Web Design class, I redesigned the Lonely Planet's Antarctica website as a final project.
This focused on learning and experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. Maps were designed using ArcMap and Adobe Illustrator.
Since this is a design focused, I did not create the website to be responsive.
